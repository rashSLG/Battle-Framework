# Sonic Battle Framework

![image](sbf_logo.png)

An open source remake of Sonic Battle in the Godot engine that aims to turn it into a moddable framework. Our goal is to not only recreate Sonic Battle but also create a 3D fighting game engine that supports custom content (similar to MUGEN). Developers can also fork this repo to modify the engine and create their own 3D fighting game.


### Current Status
This project is currently early in development. As of right now we have 1 playable character (Sonic) with the base Sonic Battle movement system and attack system implemented.

### Godot Version
This project is currently using Godot 4.4 Stable.
